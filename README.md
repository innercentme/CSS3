# CSS3
        CSS is a styling language used to modify the appearance of web pages. The basic syntax of CSS includes selectors and rules.
    Selectors are used to target specific elements that you want to style. They can be HTML tags (e.g., h1, p), classes (e.g., .container), or IDs (e.g., #header).
    Rules define the styles that you want to apply to the selected elements. Each rule consists of a property and its value. For example, color: blue; sets the text color to blue.

    There are different ways to include CSS in your HTML document:

    1. Inline Styles: Styles can be directly applied to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. For example, <p style="color: blue;">This text will be blue.</p>.

    2. Internal CSS: You can include CSS styles within the <style> tags in the <head> section of your HTML document. This is done by writing CSS rules directly in between the opening and closing <style> tags.

    3.External CSS: It is considered best practice to separate CSS styles into an external CSS file with a .css extension. This file is linked to your HTML document using the <link> tag within the <head> section. For example, <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">.

    By using these different methods, you can apply styles to your HTML elements and achieve the desired visual presentation on your web page.
