Welcome to my repository! Here you will find a beginner-friendly CSS3 course that provides an excellent foundation for those who are new to CSS. This course is designed to help you build a strong understanding of CSS concepts and techniques.

To navigate through the course materials, you can make use of the branches in the repository on the GitHub page. Here's how you can do it:

Start by visiting the repository on GitHub.
Look for the "Branch" dropdown menu located near the top-left corner of the repository page.
Click on the dropdown menu and select the branch corresponding to the specific topic or module you want to explore.
Once you select a branch, the repository page will refresh, and you will be able to access the files and content specific to that branch.
By organizing the course materials into different branches, you can easily navigate through the topics and access the relevant content as you progress through the course.

Note: If you're new to GitHub or need more detailed instructions, you can refer to GitHub's documentation or tutorials on how to navigate and switch branches in a repository.
