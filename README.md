# CSS3

Universal selector (*):

The * selector selects all elements on the page. This means that the styles applied to the universal selector will be applied to every element on the page.
For example: * { property: value; } - all elements on the page will have the specified property and value.
Element selector (for example, p):

The p selector selects all <p> elements, i.e. paragraphs, on the page.
For example: p { property: value; } - all paragraphs on the page will have the specified property and value.
Class selector (for example, .classname):

The .classname selector selects all elements with a specific value of the class attribute.
For example: .highlight { property: value; } - all elements with the highlight class will have the specified property and value.
ID selector (for example, #idname):

The #idname selector selects an element with a specific value of the id attribute.
For example: #header { property: value; } - the element with the header id will have the specified property and value.
Child selector (for example, p span):

The p span selector selects <span> elements that are children of <p> elements.
For example: p span { property: value; } - all <span> elements that are children of <p> elements will have the specified property and value.

These selectors allow you to precisely select and customise styles for different elements in your HTML code.
