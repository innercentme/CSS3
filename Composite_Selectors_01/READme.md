# Composite Selectors 01

In this HTML code example, we have a structure with an "<h1>" header, a "<div>" container, and some elements such as an "<h2>" header, a "<p>" paragraph, and a "<ul>" list with "<li> list elements.

In the CSS code, we apply styles to these elements using compound selectors:

".container h2 selects the <h2>" element, which is a child of the element with the ".container class".
".container p selects a <p>" element that is a child of an element with the ".container class.".
"ul li" selects all "<li>" elements that are children of the "<ul>" element.
You can change the styles in the CSS code to suit your own design and needs.
