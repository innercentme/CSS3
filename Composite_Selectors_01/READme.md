# Composite Selectors 01

In this HTML code example, we have a structure with an <h 1> header, a <d iv> container, and some elements such as an <h 2> header, a <p > paragraph, and a <u l> list with <l i> list elements.

In the CSS code, we apply styles to these elements using compound selectors:

. container h 2 selects the <h 2> element, which is a child of the element with the . container class.
. container p selects a <p > element that is a child of an element with the . container class.
ul li selects all <l i> elements that are children of the <u l> element.
You can change the styles in the CSS code to suit your own design and needs.
