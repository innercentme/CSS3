# Composite Selectors 02

Here's an explanation of when to use the +, >, ~ operators in CSS:

The + operator (Adjacent Sibling Selector):

Used when you need to select an element that is an immediate successor and has the same parent element.
For example, you can use it to select the first element in a list after the heading or the element that immediately follows another element in the markup.
The > operator (Child Selector):

Use this operator when you want to select an element that is a direct child of a particular parent element.
For example, you can use it to select all <li> elements that are direct children of the <ul> element.
General Sibling Selector:

Used when you want to select all subsequent elements that have the same parent element.
For example, you can use it to select all elements after a particular heading or elements that follow another element in the markup.
